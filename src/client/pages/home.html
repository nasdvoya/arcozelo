                With my feet upon the ground
                I lose myself between the sounds
                And open wide to suck it in
                I feel it move across my skin
                I'm reaching up and reaching out
                I'm reaching for the random or
                Whatever will bewilder me
                Whatever will be willed of me
                And following our will and wind
                We may just go where no one's been
                We'll ride the spiral to the end
                And may just go where no one's been
                Spiral out, keep going
                Spiral out, keep going
                Spiral out, keep going
